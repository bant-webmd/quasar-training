ADD FIREBASE TO THE PROJECT USING BOOTFILE 
----------------
- BOOTFILES: 
    - You can run things that need to be injected into the global Vue instance 
    - You can tweak router settings
    - You can Add analytics scripts that run upon booting up. 
    - We use a bootfile to run code before the app starts 
        - run: quasar new boot <nameOfBootfile> 
        - Then add the bootfile name to the quasar.conf boot array 

- OUR USAGE: 
    - In our case we don't need access to the Vue instance or anything like that. We simply want to initialize the firebase package with our configuration. 
    - This way when we call firebase in the app it'll have the proper config. 

- Create the bootfile -> quasar new boot firebase 
    - Delete the default contents (we don't need to inject)
- Go to console.firebase.google.com 
    - Go to awesometodo project 
    -> Click "Add app" at the top 
    -> Click the web set up 
    -> Name it "Awesome Todo - Web" 
    -> Click "Register App"
- Grab config from the generated page 
    - Paste into bootfile along with initialize line. 
- Install firebase package via npm 
    -> npm install --save firebase 
- Import firebase package in the bootfile 
    - store config in firebaseConfig var  
    - remove firestore import 
    - Store initialization into a variable firebaseApp
        - pass firebaseConfig to the initialization call  
    - call auth() on firebaseApp and store result in firebaseAuth variable 
    - export {firebaseAuth}
        - Now this variable will be available within our app.
