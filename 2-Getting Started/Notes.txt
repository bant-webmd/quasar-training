PAGES: 
- Similar to pages in Nuxt

CSS:
- By default Quasar uses stylus styles 
- Also starts project with some color variables 
- You can customize this yourself and use SCSS/LESS if you want as well 

ROUTES: 
- Routes are configured in the router/routes.js file 
- This is done similar to the traditional vue-router  
- Basically here is where you map paths to page-level components.
