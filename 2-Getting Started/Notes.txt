FOLDER STRUCTURE 
---------------- 
- App.vue is the root file 

LAYOUTS: 
- layouts/MyLayout.vue 
- Similar to layouts in Nuxt 
- Layouts > Pages 

PAGES: 
- Similar to pages in Nuxt 
- Pages > Components 

ASSETS:
- Everything in this folder will be processed by webpack
    - Images here may be converted into base64 code 

BOOT: 
- We put boot files here
- These files allow you to execute code before the app starts up 

CSS:
- By default Quasar uses stylus styles 
- Also starts project with some color variables 
- You can customize this yourself and use SCSS/LESS if you want as well 

ROUTER: 
- Routes are configured in the router/routes.js file 
- This is done similar to the traditional vue-router  
- Basically here is where you map paths to page-level components. 

STATICS: 
- This is where you put static assets 
- Files in here will not be processed by webpack (they will be used as they are)

STORE: 
- This is where you put the Vuex store.
