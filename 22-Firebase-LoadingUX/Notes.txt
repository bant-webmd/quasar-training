ADD A LOADING VIEW FOR THE TODO PAGE     
----------------
- Create vuex state properties that track if the firebase data is loaded or not 
- Set these in the firebase reading operations 
    - If not set show quasar loading component 
    - If set don't show quasar loading component 

----------------
HIDE LOADING VIEW WHEN TASKS DOWNLOADED      
----------------
- HOW CAN WE KNOW WHEN WE'VE COMPLETED LOADING DATA FROM FIREBASE? 
    - Firebase provides hooks!
- In fbReadData action add the following:  
    // initial check for data 
    // add once listener for the 'value' event 
    // 'value' event emitted when a value is returned from the reference node 
    userTasks.once('value', snapshot => {
        commit('setTasksDownloaded', true)
    })

- In handleAuthStateChange upon logout commit the 'setTasksDownloaded' mutation and pass false. 
    - Basically reset the store once logging out.
