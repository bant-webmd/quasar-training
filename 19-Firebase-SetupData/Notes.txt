DATA STRUCTURE DESIGN 
----------------
- Need to be able to store data for all our users, not just one 
- When we grab data from firebase, we grab a whole node of data 
    - Unlike a SQL database, we can't filter the node's data by property.
    - It's best to have user specific data be contained under that userID 

EXAMPLE:
    tasks: {
        'userID': {
            'Task1: {
                ...
            }
            'Task2: {
                ...
            }
        }
    }

ADD DATA TO FIREBASE USING IMPORT  
----------------
- You can export data from a firebase node as a JSON file 
- Similarly you can import data if its formatted as JSON  
- We should seed our data in this way
